#Day1
git init (delete .git folder if don't want Version)

$ npx create-react-app 01basicreact (slow type)

{check for possible *scripts* in Package.json}
$ npm run start
$ npm run dev
$ npm run build

[create project using Vite]
$ npm create vite@latest (the, $npm i)
$ yarn create vite (then, $ yarn)

#Day2
[notes]
- in vite+react, we can create and save a component like shivam.jsx and recall it in the main.jsx , using the similar protocols.
$ import ShivamDamn from "./Shivam.jsx"
$ <ShivamDamn/>

[vite+react]
-And in React only, we will save the file as Shivam.js, and follow the similar protocols.
- in main.jsx, all the components are called.
- in App.jsx, function App(){...} is defined which returns html like:
function App() {
	return(
		<>
		<h1>Hello there</h1>
		<p> Nice to meet you!</p>
		</>
	)}

export default App;

- in main.jsx, it'd be like just with similar protocols(rules):
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.jsx"
...
in reactdom, call
<App/>
<ShivamDamn/>

(make sure these are exported in there .jsx files)

- similar progress is in just React, only diffrence is that the files(component files) are created in .js format, like Shivam.js

-- in React only, the main file is index.js & in Vite+React, the main file is main.jsx

- the component function name must start with a Uppercase letter like Blog(), not blog()

- by convention, If file is returning HTML code, then the file extension must be .jsx, but if the file only returning Javascript code, then it should be .js only

#Day3 (customReactJs)
[vite+react]
- functions can be written in the main.jsx and can be recalled in it. (not suggested btw)
const newFunc = function () {
	return (
		<>
		<h1>new function here.</h1>
		</>
	)
}
& in render >>> <newFunc/>

- We can also store value of constants in any components(app.jsx,shivam.jsx) and store value string number or anything else.
And recall in the return tag in {} (mind: only constants can be called, not statements)

#Day4
[vite+react] basics/hooks

- the UI changing is taken care by React.
-to define a variable, whose value is to be updated in the UI, then we define it by:
	import {useState} from "react";				(hooks)
	let [counter, setCounter] = useState(15);
- when we are to change the value, we do:
	setCounter(counter+1)		, or.	
	setCounter(counter-1)		, or.		
	setCounter(counter="Invalid")		

#Day5
[vite+React] React Fibres(Virt DOM)
- take a look: https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture
~important points~
- The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. (React's fastness and non reloading of th website=+++)
Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.
- Other key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in;
the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.
- Diffing of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be "stable, predictable, and unique."
- The key points are:
		- In a UI, it's not necessary for every update to be applied immediately;
		in fact, doing so can be wasteful, causing frames to drop and degrading the user experience.
		- Different types of updates have different priorities â€” an animation update needs to complete more quickly than, say, 
		an update from a data store.
		- A push-based approach requires the app (you, the programmer) to decide how to schedule work.
		A pull-based approach allows the framework (React) to be smart and make those decisions for you.

#Day6
[vite+React] Tailwind and props

- Tailwind installation in a React Application
	- visit: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite
	- or,{
	npm create vite@latest my-project -- --template react
	cd my-project
	npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
	npx tailwindcss init -p
	} + changes in tailwind.config.js + index.css
- more components are here: https://www.devui.io/components
- And, Tailblocks: https://tailblocks.cc/

[props]
in card.jsx
- function Card({aboutWho}) {
	<p>My name is {aboutWho}</p>
	... }
then in App.jsx we can,
	<Card aboutWho="Shivam Verma" />
- props are used in components, for changing any name, link , photo, etc. in a component,
(could be for displaying card or showing photo, etc.)

#Day7
[interview questions]
-  if userState counter(=15), setCounter exists, then if:
code;
const btnAddVal = () => {
	single batch considered~ {{{ setCounter(counter+1)	// only 16 will be printed
	setCounter(counter+1)	// only 16 will be printed
	setCounter(counter+1)	// only 16 will be printed
	setCounter(counter+1) }}}	// only 16 will be printed, because Fibre words/updates website in patches
}
- so to do so,do:
code;
const btnAddVal = () => {
	setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter + 1)	// 16 will be printed
	setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter + 1)	// 17 will be printed
	setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter + 1)	// 18 will be printed
	setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter + 1)	// 19 will be printed (final updation)
}
	[[[this is a callback present in the setCounter]]]
