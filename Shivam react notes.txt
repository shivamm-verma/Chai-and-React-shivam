#Day2
[notes]
- in vite+react, we can create and save a component like shivam.jsx and recall it in the main.jsx , using the similar protocols.
$ import ShivamDamn from "./Shivam.jsx"
$ <ShivamDamn/>

[vite+react]
-And in React only, we will save the file as Shivam.js, and follow the similar protocols.
- in main.jsx, all the components are called.
- in App.jsx, function App(){...} is defined which returns html like:
function App() {
	return(
		<>
		<h1>Hello there</h1>
		<p> Nice to meet you!</p>
		</>
	)}

export default App;

- in main.jsx, it'd be like just with similar protocols(rules):
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.jsx"
...
in reactdom, call
<App/>
<ShivamDamn/>

(make sure these are exported in there .jsx files)

- similar progress is in just React, only diffrence is that the files(component files) are created in .js format, like Shivam.js

-- in React only, the main file is index.js & in Vite+React, the main file is main.jsx

- the component function name must start with a Uppercase letter like Blog(), not blog()

- by convention, If file is returning HTML code, then the file extension must be .jsx, but if the file only returning Javascript code, then it should be .js only
